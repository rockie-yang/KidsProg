Teaching kids programming could be tricky. They will certain loose interesting at any minute. How to keep his interesting is a big challenge to me. I need give him some immediate effect. All those grammar stuff could only be explained on the way.

The second lesson is just show a Hello World message box, a tradition start. Using Tkinter is fairly easy.

Type in following code. IntelliJ IDEA has very good code completion, it avoids quite some typing error.

```python

import Tkinter
import tkMessageBox

top = Tkinter.Tk()

def helloCallBack():
      tkMessageBox.showinfo("Hello Python", "Hello World")

b = Tkinter.Button(top, text="Hello", command=helloCallBack, width=100, bitmap="error")

b.pack()

top.mainloop()

```

* Save and Run the program
* Experience change text values

He has no sense about those programming terms what so ever. I got to found some good metaphors. Today is for Function Parameter Callback.

> When I tell you run. That run is a Function
> Then if I did not say anything more. You could run forever
> Then I tell you, time=3 minutes, speed=medium. time and speed are parameters.
> I also tell you, after you finished run, call me. call me is a call back.
