My 10 years old son Bobben is very interested to making some games.I had been asked teaching him programming for a while. I thought it might not a bad idea give it a try after a long hesitate. Don't know how far we could go though.

For programming language, either Python or JavaScript is suitable in my mind. There might be other suitable language as well. Since I know Python a bit better than JavaScript. So Python was chosen for the journey.
