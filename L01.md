My 10 years old son Bobben is very interested to making some games.I had been asked teaching him programming for a while. I thought it might not a bad idea give it a try after a long hesitate.

For programming language, either Python or JavaScript is suitable. Since I know Python a bit better than JavaScript. So Python was chosen for the journey.

He has been using a Mac Book Air for a while. So he know how to use a computer quite well although mainly just for gaming, video watching.

He had been doing quite some paper work for calculating. Just try to give him a little sweet. So for the first lesson, start from the calculator. Basically just using the Python shell.

* Start Terminal from the Dock
* Type python to open Python shell
* Basic + - * /
* Brackets ()
* Remainder %
* He was really excited about the first lessen for how simple to do math.
