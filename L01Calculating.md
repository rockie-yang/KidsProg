Lesson 1 Calculating
====================

My 10 years old son Bobben is very interested to making some games.I had been asked teaching him programming for a while. I thought it might not a bad idea give it a try after a long hesitate. Don't know how far we could go though.

For programming language, either Python or JavaScript is suitable in my mind. There might be other suitable language as well. Since I know Python a bit better than JavaScript. So Python was chosen for the journey.

He has been using a Mac Book Air for a while. So he know how to use a computer quite well although mainly just for gaming and watching video.

He had been doing quite some paper work for calculating. Doing multiplication and division is quite time consuming and error proven job. Just try to give him a little sweet. So for the first lesson, start from calculating using python shell.

* Start Terminal from the Dock
* Type python to open Python shell
* Basic + - * /
* Brackets ()
* Remainder %
* Exit the Python shell by typing exit()

He was really excited about the first lessen for how simple to do math.
